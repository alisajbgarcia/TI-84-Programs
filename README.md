# TI-84-Programs
Useful programs for TI calculators.


# Programs:

### Cross Product:

Calculates the cross product of a 3 x 3 matrix. Takes 9 inputs that represent 9 entries of a matrix. Produces the discriminant in vector form.

### Discriminant:

Calculates the number of solutions for a quadratic equation in standard form. Takes 3 inputs that represent the 3 constants a, b, c in a standarm form equation. Displays the discriminant value and interprets the discriminant as no real solutions, one solution, or two solutions for the quadratic equation. 

### Distance:

Calculates the distance between two points. Takes 4 inputs that represent the x and y values for both points. Displays the distance between the two points.

### Midpoint:

Calculates the midpoint between two points. Takes 4 inputs that represent the x and y values for both points. Displays the midpoint coordinates. 

### Point Slope:

Calculates the equation between two points. Takes 4 inputs that represent the x and y values for both points. Displays the found equation in simplified point slope form.

### Quadratic:

Calculates both solutions for a quadratic equation in standard form. Informs the user that 'A + Bi' mode must be turned on in order to accomodate for imaginary solutions. Takes 3 inputs that represent the constants a, b, and c. Displays both solutions, reduced.

### RadianOrDegrees

Converts radians to degrees or vice versa. Prompts the user to choose if they want to find radians or degrees. Takes 1 input that represents radians or degrees. Displays the resulting converstion.
